guash is an interpreter that implements the GuaraScript programming language.

MaiaScript is a programming language aimed at developing adaptable and
intelligent applications. An adaptive application modifies its code to
suit the conditions of the environment. An intelligent application,
it learns to process the data it receives and adjusts to possible changes
in its characteristics, over time. The MaiaScript language implements the
adaptation paradigm, combining it with a variation of the object-oriented
paradigm, simplified to exclude definitions of types and access restrictions.
These characteristics make MaiaScript a programming language suitable for
rapid learning, both by Computer Science professionals and scientists who
are starting to implement computational algorithms. The characteristics of
this language, also allow the rapid development of complex applications,
especially when adaptability is necessary. MaiaScript also presents a syntax
similar to that used in Mathematics, including libraries for Numerical Calculation,
Complex Network Analysis, Database Access, Regular Expression Processing, and an
abstraction layer between the MaiaScript interpreter and the underlying Operating System.

The complete documentation, including the EBNF grammar file and the compiler's
syntax diagrams (railroad diagrams) can be found in the grammar directory.

<script type = "text/maiascript"> ... </script>

To compile and run the scripts configure the page's onload event to execute
the "maiavm.compile()" method:

<body onload = "maiavm.compile();" ... </body>
